Depression Level Classification of Social Media Users from Sentiment Analysis (Tweets) and using NLP-based Approach with Naive Bayesian, Decision Tree and KNN classifiers. I also did carried out comparative evaluations of Three Dimensionality reduction techniques on the models namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Kernel PCA.

## Tools Used:
ML Models: Decision Tree, Naive Baye's, Random Forest, K-Means CLustering (used for Re-labelling).

NLP-Models: BOW, TF-IDF, Keras Tokenizer

Tools: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, re, MinMaxScaler, wordCloud, pickle and joblib (to save and retrieve trained models)
